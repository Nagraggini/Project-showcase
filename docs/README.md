# Projects & Experience

I started this project to truly learn web development—not just by watching tutorials, but by putting them into practice.

The tasks have been getting progressively more challenging, as you’ll see. I hope that by the end, I’ll have successfully learned how to build for the web.

You can start here:

How to run the frontend?

How to run the backend?

I use [Vercel](https://vercel.com) to host my Python dynamic website
